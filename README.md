# Elite : Harmless #

_Elite : Harmless_ is a greatly enhanced version of the [Commodore 64][c64] port of the seminal space-trading-combat sim [_Elite_][elite], made possible by a full disassembly.

## State Of The Project ##

The game is disassembled but documentation is on-going.  
Some improvements have been implemented, see below.
Help is needed in these areas:

* Understanding / commenting the 3D math code
* Commenting SID code (I know literally nothing of audio theory)
* See also the [list of "Help Wanted" issues][helpw]

## Improvements Implemented ##

* _Multiplication routine upgraded to a faster version:_ I was able to free up 2 KB and insert some multiplication look-up tables which gives a general speed-up for 3D math

* Faster line-drawing code, provided by [dyme](https://github.com/dyme6510)

* _The code was unnecessarily storing and copying the blank space either side of the HUD_, where the C64's screen is 320px wide rather than 256px on the BBC, on *every frame*; and with an inefficient copy routine. Needless to say, in _Elite : Harmless_ the blank space is neither stored nor copied and the copy method is much faster

## Planned Improvements ##

* [Speed improvements][speed]
* "Quality of Life" improvements, making the game [more accessible][ease] to new players and players who may never have played an 8-bit or C64 game before
* [Feature enhancements][feat]
* See the complete [list of issues][issues]

## Getting _Elite : Harmless_ ##

Due to legal concerns, _Elite : Harmless_ binaries (i.e. disk images) are not made available, you will have to build the source code yourself using the instructions provided in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
